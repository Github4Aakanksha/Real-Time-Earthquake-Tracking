# Real-Time-Earthquake-Tracking
Business Problem: How can we automate real-time earthquake tracking and present the updates in a simple, user-friendly way for everyone?

I developed a solution to automate the collection and organization of real-time earthquake data from the Southern California Earthquake Data Center (SCEDC) using Google Cloud. I created a Python-based Google Cloud Function that retrieves critical earthquake details—magnitude, location, depth, and timestamp—and updates a Google Sheet in real time, ensuring seamless data synchronization without manual intervention. To make the process even more user-friendly, I built an optional Flask app that provides a simple interface to trigger updates and visualize the data. By integrating tools like gspread and oauth2client, this scalable, cloud-powered project makes tracking seismic activity accessible for both technical users and the general public.
